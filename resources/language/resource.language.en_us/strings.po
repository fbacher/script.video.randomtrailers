# Types of videos that can be played as a "trailer":
# 'Trailer', 'Featurette', 'Clip', 'Teaser', Behind the Scenes'
# Used in label for a movie: <movie_title> <(release_year)> - <trailer_sources> <trailer_type>
# <trailer_sources> can be a single source: Library, TFH, or TMDb.
#                   or when a 'trailer' is being played from a remote service (like TMDb)
#                      AND the movie is also in the local library, then the label is:
#                   <movie_title> <(release_year)> - <remote_source> / Library <trailer_type>
#
# Examples: Gone With the Wind (1939) - TFH / Library Trailer
#           Gone With the Wind (1939) - TMDb Featurette
