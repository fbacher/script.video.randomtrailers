         <!-- The different sources of certificat/rating information
                (TMDB, IMDB, iTunes, etc.) return different values. Further,
                certifications change over time. In the U.S., the Hays
                code was in effect through mid 1968. This code only had a
                rating of "Passed" (or "Approved"). The MPAA rating system
                started in 1968 and has had multiple changes over time. For
                a while, there was an "M" (Mature) rating which later became
                "PG-13". There was a GP rating which later became "PG". TMDB
                currently only supports the current rating system.

                TMDB has no representation for older certification values
                    (i.e. 'M' for Mature or 'GP' now 'PG' or 'Passed' from pre-1968.

                The rules here provide a means to "scrape" the ratings stored
                in Kodi and convert them into a something which can be used to
                filter and compare with. The certification for a particular movie
                will come from Kodi. Each certification specifies a suggested
                appropriate "age" of the viewer. This could be used for comparison,
                even between different country's rating systems (although
                different cultures have very different attitudes about what is
                appropriate for viewing). -->
