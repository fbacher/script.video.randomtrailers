RELEASE NOTES

 For the latest information see:
  https://github.com/fbacher/Kodi-script.video.randomtrailers/wiki/Release-Notes

02/09/2021 2.0.4-alpha1
Major Release, complete rewrite.

The default settings will play trailers from your video library, whether
the trailers are local or a URL. In addition, trailers from Trailers From Hell
(TFH) and TMDb will be downloaded and played. By changing settings Random
Trailers will search for missing trailers for movies in your library from
TMDb and download them. Since this is expensive to run, you may want to
configure a related setting to limit how often this is performed.

Downloaded trailers will be cached by default in
 <kodi_dir>/userdata/addon_data/script.video.randomtrailers/cache.

BUGS, LIMITATIONS
See issues on https://github.com/fbacher/Kodi-script.video.randomtrailers

TFH index discovery
The current implementation requires that the entire TFH index be downloaded
in a single session, which can take hours. Once created it will not be
rebuilt for about 60 days (controlled by a setting).
Before release, this will be changed to do incremental downloads.

Caching issues
Metadata for downloaded movies as well as downloaded trailers are stored in the cache.
The cache garbage collector works fairly well. There are several known issues:

* If you change TMDb settings, the plugin forgets about what it has downloaded
before (although the garbage collector still works). This means, for example,
that if you disable TMDb trailers, then re-enable them, then new, possibly different,
trailers are downloaded, even though the previously downloaded ones are still there.

The solution is multi-part:
* Add setting to purge cache of data from that source (TMDb, TFH, etc.)

* Any data not purged, is persisted across settings changes, without any
"amnesia" as it is now

* Add setting to purge cache of anything that does not pass current filter
settings.

* Add setting to (not purge) filter cached movies based upon settings. This will
allow one to temporarily alter what is viewed, such as genre or year range,
without destroying cache.

* Random Trailers can NOT be debugged with pydevd at this time. A Kodi change
  broke this and a partial fix does not completely cure. Needs investigation.

YouTube issues:
If you experience trailer downloading issues, you may need to go to your browser
and try to play any youtube video. It might prompt you to prove that you are
a human. This can occur when too much is downloaded too fast. This is most
likely to occur if you restart Kodi multiple times while it is initially
building the TFH index (described above). Random Trailers has pauses between
downloads to avoid this problem, but sometimes this is insufficient.

TMDb issues:
If you have trouble downloading TMDb information it may be do to too many
users of this plugin downloading at the same time. This can be avoided by
getting your own TMDb API key. See
https://github.com/fbacher/Kodi-script.video.randomtrailers/wiki/Beta-Testing

TMDb Certification, language, etc. is not always correct. This can cause
inappropriate content to be played, despite your settings.

TFH issues:
TFH does not provide any movie details other than the title. The rest of the
data comes from TMDb. Since there can be more than one movie with the same
title, Random Trailers makes a best guess, but it can be wrong. In particular,
the Certification (MPAA) rating can be wrong, resulting in inappropriate
content being played.

TFH trailers do sometimes contain nudity, etc. Some of these may not be
filtered out by your settings.

the following:

<advancedsettings>
    <loglevel>1</loglevel>
    <debug>
         <extralogging>false</extralogging>
    </debug>
</advancedsettings>

Next, configure Random Trailers plugin settings. Select "Experimental" tab,
then select "Enable Debug", Choose "Logging Level" of "EXTRA VERBOSE DEBUG",
also enable other radio buttons.

Restart Kodi, reproduce problem.
Paste the entire kodi.log,
 <kodi_install_dir>/userdata/addon_data/script.video.randomtrailers/settings.xml
 and a description of the problem to: https://paste.kodi.tv/.
