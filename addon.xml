        <news>2.0.7+beta.5 (12/11/2021)
               Addressed several major caching issues that turned up from Beta tester with ONLY library movies and NO trailers.
               This turned up cache limitations, all related to TMDb serving trailers and data for multiple sources: TFH, Library,
               TMDb and possibly others. This requires tracking each source that references TMDb data/trailers.

               Next came the realization that when all trailers are remote, that discovery algorithms had to be tweaked in order
               to have a good mix of movies with trailers/data which are easy to fulfill along with movies which will take more
               effort/time to fulfill. Otherwise, the player could get stuck not playing anything for long periods of time.

               To reduce duplicate data/trailer downloads and disk usage, keep only one shared copy.

               Investigated very slow video downloading times from Youtube. It seems that youtube throttles traffic under
               certain circumstatnces, which impacts youtube-dl. Youtube-dl development seems to have slowled down significantly.
               Work around is to change to use a varient of youtube-dl. Not sure if problem turns up only
               after so much traffic has occurred. Will investiate further.
            2.0.7+beta.3 (10/09/2021)
               VideoDownloader would abort on some meaningless warnings
               Fixed locking issues in VideoDownloader
               TFH cache not recognized as being already built
               VideoDownloader sometimes hung in the hang detection loop (oops)
               2.0.7+beta.2 (10/04/2021)
               Fixed:
               #14 Thread blocked an hour or so building a map of library to tmdb_id on every run with default settings.
               #13 Trailers for movies in local database not downloaded
               #1 Change of settings not properly purging caches, etc. (mostly fixed)
               Improved UI responsiveness and reliability. There were some situations where the UI could lock up or behave unexpectedly.
               This tended to occur when navigation buttons quickly pressed (SHOW_INFO, LEFT, RIGHT, PAUSE, STOP, etc.). Model made
               more MVC. Still not perfect.
